# Read About Added Template

I added 4 pages for you to start integrating
-Dashboard
-login
-signin
-otpVerify
you will also need to add your database again because I remove mine after cloning.

# Note
You will be working on these once while I work on the rest,
Don't touch the static file for now, work on only the template,
and if you get confused ask chatGPT before asking me ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž.

# Also
I commented your other urls, I don't know why but, something there is making the application
run slow. So remove all the old template and start using the new once.
